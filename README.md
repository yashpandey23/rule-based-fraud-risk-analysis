# Rule-Based Customer Fraud Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end rule-based fraud risk analysis system designed to identify high-risk customers using behavioral and transactional indicators.

## Business Problem
Digital platforms face increasing fraud risk due to unauthorized access, abnormal login behavior, and suspicious device activity. Manual monitoring does not scale effectively.

## Solution Approach
- Data extraction and validation using SQL
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and rule logic using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Rule-based customer risk profiling
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for executive reporting

## Fraud Risk Indicators
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Login location changes
- Future or inconsistent signup dates
- Abnormal device usage behavior

## Key Insights
- Total Active Customers: 289
- High-Risk Customers: 121
- Low-Risk Customers: 168
- Fraud Risk Rate: 41.9%

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Power BI

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook (analysis & rules)
- Power BI Dashboard
- Final Analytical Report (PDF)
